## Simon's README:
Hi, I’m Simon James Puttock (@sentinal-x), a BSc Computer Science graduate and Environmental Intelligence PhD Student at the University Of Exeter.
I'm interested in the following topics:

- Using Network Science to enhance our comprehension of social environments, both physically and digitally.
- Examining the fusion of nature and computing in 'Nature-Inspired Computing', exploring how AI and Machine Learning can draw inspiration from the natural world.
- Leveraging data to deepen our understanding of Earth's rich history (and dinosaurs).

**PhD Research:**

Topic: *Climate Misinformation on Wikipedia*.

- I am looking into understanding and mitigating the spread of misinformation on one of the world's largest collaborative knowledge platforms - Wikipedia.
- I plan on utilizing Network Science, Natural Language Processing, and LLMS to analyze and comprehend the complexities of misinformation networks.
- This is part of an interdisciplinary approach in the EI CDT where I am bridging the gap between Computer Science, Climate Science, and Social Science to gain a comprehensive understanding of the impact of climate misinformation.
